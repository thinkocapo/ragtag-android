### Tips
If you can't find a file in the Project viewer, try changing its dropdown to/from *Project Files* or *Project* and you might find your files

#### Logcat - Android Console
For viewing INFO and ERRORS
Change the dropdown between INFO and ERRORS
To find logs you're writing in an activity, for example, type 'MainActivity' in the search field and it will show all the logs from MainActivity, becaused they used LOG_TAG='MainActivity'
