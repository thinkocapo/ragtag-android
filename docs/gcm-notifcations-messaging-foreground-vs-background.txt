Foreground Notifications
I.e. when app activity is running
No push notification is received in the notification bar
However, onMessageReceived() is still called and the data payload is accessible
This happens in MyFirebaseMessagingService.java (call it ForegroundMessagingService.java in ragTag)
Log information viewable under ‘Verbose’ option, not ‘Info’.
Data comes into the callback as RemoteMessage type

Background Notifications
I.e. when app activity is in paused state (user put app to the background)
Push notification is received in notification bar
onCreate() is executed and data payload is accessible
This happens in OnPushNotification.java (call it BackgroundMessagingService.java in ragTag)
Uses android intent-filter to receive the click_action notification and start the onCreate() method of BackgroundMessagingService activity
Log information viewable under ‘Info’ option
Scroll down and see Background_Notes for more info on how this works
Data comes into the callback as Bundle type.

Message will not come through as both foreground and background type at same time. It will always be one or the other.

Problem: What if user doesn’t have app running in foreground or background? E.g. phone is off
Solution: When user starts the app, app does http request (CloudFunction) for update on what happened (i.e. current latlong’s of all users, and tag history (i.e. who tagged me recently)) 

Solution:
onResume() onStart()
Get updated latlong’s of all users and render on map (googleMap?)
Get tag history (history of who tagged the user while user’s app was paused or off)
Visual indicator on map of which users were the taggers
Send updated latlong (for other users to see)

Phase1:
Fixed view Google Map (earth or navigation) in MainActivity. Show users on it.
Data Model https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/structure-data

Phase2:
Sound, images for users
Geofences

HowTo:
People on stackoverflow say Firebase Console won’t trigger onMessageReceived(), so you need to hit this endpoint instead (using REST API client like Postman):

Setup - Create a class called OnPushNotification (or use your MainActivity Class?)
AndroidManifest.xml
<activity android:name=".OnPushNotification">
   <intent-filter>
       <action android:name=".OnPushNotification"/>
       <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
   </intent-filter>
</activity>

Log in the onCreate() method and access the received intent’s data through bundle:
Bundle bundle = getIntent().getExtras();
if (bundle != null) {
   Log.i(TAG, "onCreate() | there's a bundle");
   //bundle must contain all info sent in "data" field of the notification
}

Headers:
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: key={key_from_FirebaseConsole>Settings>ProjectSettings>CloudMessaging>ServerKey}
body:
{ 
 "notification" : {
        "click_action" : ".OnPushNotification", 
        "body" : "details about tagging", 
        "title" : "You got tagged!"
 "data": { 
 	"will_custom_key" : "will_custom_value2",
    "will_other_key" : true
 },
 "to" : "{your_AppToken_From_FirebaseInstanceIdService} }

Response:
{
  "multicast_id": 5280269500366036671,
  "success": 1,
  "failure": 0,
  "canonical_ids": 0,
  "results": [
    {
      "message_id": "0:1493591189157860%ad09dfc2ad09dfc2"
    }
  ]
}


Background_Notes:
Push Notification is received in Background (app is in Paused (minimized) state)
Click the push notification and it opens the app, and OnPushNotification.onCreate() executes
‘Click_action’ was also an option
The data should be in the Bundle. bundle_instance.toString() or other getters by key
The first time that FirebaseInstanceIdService generates your token, make sure you write it down, because I can’t get onTokenRefresh() to execute ever again. One time only?
