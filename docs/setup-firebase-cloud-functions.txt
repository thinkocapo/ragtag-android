How to Link the Firebase Cloud Functions Project to your Local Machine, and Deploy


Overview and instructions of how it works. Same instructions i used:
https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started

0. 
npm install -g firebase-tools

1.
git clone https://wcapozzoli124@bitbucket.org/wcapozzoli124/ragtagcloudfunctions.git

2.
firebase login
cd project
firebase init functions

You’ll be asked to create a new project, or choose an existing. If the Firebase Project administrator (William) shared permissions with you, then you should see it as an option. Select it, and you can skip step 2.

3. If you’re creating a new project then select cloud functions:
- firebase database
+ firebase cloud functions
- firebase hosting

4. Make your updates (i.e. write your CloudFunctions in project/index.js) then deploy
firebase deploy --only functions


Extra:
Cloud Functions Emulator (run locally. I’ve never tried this with ragtag)
